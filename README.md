# Bilinear-Pairing
Pair based cryptography implementation of a secure data sharing framework using the JPBC 2.0.0 library. I am working on this project for my summer 2015 REU at Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Currently working:<br>
-Data owner and user key generation<br>
-Proxy re-encryption key generation<br>
-Proxy re-encryption of integer by oracle and decryption by user<br>
-File encryption (Still some potential bugs to work out)<br>

To do list:<br>
-Add support for multithreading
-Authorization token generation
-Clean code, seperate classes, and add better commenting
